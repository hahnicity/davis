## Attending

Anyone interested in learning about    
1) using container technology from `Docker` to capture software deployment for    

* building reproducible scientific software and / or
* teaching and /or
* scaling distributed apps on the cloud 

2) how to update the `HackerWithin` Davis chapter website and use the fancy web
framework `Jekyll`

## Capturing software builds with `Docker` [[Karen Ng](karenyyng.github.io)]
As software gets more and more complicated nowadays, `Docker`
provides safe encapsulated environments to exactly capture the requirements,
installation and deployment steps. Gone are the days when one has to spend hours to read
through manuals and stack-overflow to build a piece of software, only to find the build 
broke other software on the machine. 
In this talk, I will explain how `Docker` works and why it is more lightweight
than virtual machines. Then we will have some fun building and hacking the 
`HackerWithin` Davis chapter website using `Docker`. If we have time left
during the hands-on session, we can also pull the `Docker` image of `Hortonworks Data
Platform` to play with `Hadoop` or the `Jupyter` stack image to play with `Spark
notebooks`.

### Short bio
I am a Physics PhD final year student eager to learn about different data
technologies. I just completed two internships related to scalable data
analytics, first at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab. where I built an
end-to-end data analytics pipeline with `Spark` and `Hadoop`, then at the Lawrence
Berkeley National Lab. (NERSC) for parallelizing the computation of an astrophysics 
project. I am looking for good data science career opportunities to utilize my
analytics skills. 


### Prerequisites

* Git, 
* [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (if you do not have Linux as your OS)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) 

After installing `Docker`, start the Docker daemon via `Docker quickstart
terminal`, in the new terminal, execute:

```
$ docker pull ubuntu:14.04  # optional
$ docker pull karenyng/hackerwithin_dockerfile
```
    
And download the `Git` repo for the `Hackerwithin` Davis Chapter to an
appropriate location:   

```
$ git clone https://github.com/thehackerwithin/davis.git
```
   
Attendees should also be familiar with a text editor on their laptops.

### Materials
* [Docker file](https://github.com/karenyyng/hackerwithin_dockerfile) for the
    `Hackerwithin` Davis Chapter website
* [Slides](http://karenyyng.github.io/MySlideDeck/dockerTutorial.html)
