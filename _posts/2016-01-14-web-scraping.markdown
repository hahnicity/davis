## Jason K. Moore : Symbolic Mathematics with Python

[Jason](http://moorepants.info) is a lead developer with the
[SymPy](http://sympy.org) project. SymPy is a computer aided algebra (CAS)
system that allows you to use the computer instead of pencil and paper to work
out mathematical relationships. It can do algebra, trigonometry, calculus,
linear algebra, and much more. SymPy is used to power a number of apps on
different platforms and is used to drive symbolic computation in other
languages like [Octave](https://github.com/cbm755/octsympy),
[Julia](https://github.com/jverzani/SymPy.jl), and
[Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/) in addition to Python. SymPy is an open source
package developed by close to 500 developers from all around the world and
provides similar functionality as proprietary programs such as Maple,
Mathematica, MathCAD, etc. It is [utilized for high level
research](http://depsy.org/package/python/sympy) in fields such as physics,
mathematics, and engineering.
