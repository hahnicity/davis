## Attending

Anyone interested in learning about structured databases for storing and
organizing your data.

## SQL with Jim Vanderveen

This will be a short "hands-on" introduction to SQLite, demonstrating basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and your new best friend, the Data Dictionary. If time permits, we'll also cover additional topics such as NULL values, logically linking multiple tables using JOIN, and some aggregations, e.g. COUNT and SUM.

### Short bio

I've been hacking computers since 1976 when I taught myself BASIC. I started working with SQL and relational databases circa 1995. Lately I've been doing database programming for the UC Davis Library, and playing with network- and database "Internet of Things" projects in my spare time.

### Prerequisites

Attendees should have followed the [Software Carpentry Standard Installation]({{ site.url }}/swc-installation.html) on their laptops. In particular, you will need to have SQLite installed.

Attendees should also be familiar with a text editor on their laptops.

### Installation

The linked installation instructions will setup a basic environment on your
operating system of choice (Windows, Mac, Linux) that will give you access to
BASH, Python, Git, and R. In addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser.
