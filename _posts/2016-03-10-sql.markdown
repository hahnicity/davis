## Attending

Anyone interested in learning about structured databases for storing and
organizing your data.

## Relation Databases with SQL [Jim Vanderveen]

This will be a short "hands-on" introduction to the [Structured Query Language
(SQL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) with
[SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite), demonstrating basic CRUD
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and your new best friend, the Data
Dictionary. If time permits, we'll also cover additional topics such as NULL
values, logically linking multiple tables using JOIN, and some aggregations,
e.g. COUNT and SUM.

### Short bio

I've been hacking computers since 1976 when I taught myself BASIC. I started
working with SQL and relational databases circa 1995. Lately I've been doing
database programming for the UC Davis Library, and playing with network- and
database "Internet of Things" projects in my spare time.

### Prerequisites

Attendees should have followed the [Software Carpentry Standard
Installation]({{ site.url }}/swc-installation.html) on their laptops. In
particular, you will need to have SQLite installed.

The linked installation instructions will setup a basic environment on your
operating system of choice (Windows, Mac, Linux) that will give you access to
BASH, Python, Git, and R. In addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser.

Attendees should also be familiar with a text editor on their laptops.

### Optimal Control with Direct Collocation [Jason Moore]

I'll give a demo of some software that I've been developing that allows you to
express optimal control problems as a high mathematical level and automatically
solve trajectory optimization and parameter estimation problems.

### ShareLaTeX Continuous Integration [Kenneth Lyons]

ShareLaTeX provides a continuous integration (CI) service which automatically
rebuilds your LaTeX document hosted on GitHub each time you push a commit.
I will briefly walk through setting up ShareLaTeX CI and demonstrate it in
action.

### Introduction to Stan, a probabilistic programming language for Bayesian inference. [Matt Espe]

Stan is an open source, simple programming language for creating probabilistic
models and conducting inference via several methods (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,
variational inference, and optimization). Runs in C++, with interfaces to many
popular analysis programs (R, Python, Julia, command-line, Stata, etc.).
